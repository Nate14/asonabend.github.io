# Harvard Biostatistics Courses

I have worked as a Teaching Assistant at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for Statistical Learning, Data Science II (Deep Learning course), Introductory Genomics & Bioinformatics for Health Research, Applied Regression Analysis, and Practice and Culminating Experience for Quantitative Methods.  These courses are available for students in several departments at the school, they cover a wide range of applied and theoretical statistics and machine learning content.

    <p>Additionally, with the help of great collaborators and my advisor Tianxi Cai, we created the 
      <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/machine-learning-for-self-driving-cars/"> Data Science in Action: Machine Learning for Self-Driving Cars </a> course, this is a 10-day course to introduce programming and machine learning to high school students. The culminating project is to program convolutional neural networks and implement them in a self driving toy car. We have taught this course two years in a row now (2019 & 2020).

# Reinforcement Learning summer school

During the 2019 summer I taught a [Reinforcement Learning summer school](https://github.com/asonabend/RL_with_OpenAI) at the [International Meeting of Artificial Intelligence and Its Applications](https://riiaa.org/es/), the biggest Artificial Intelligence conference in Mexico. We covered the basic concepts of reinforcement learning, Q-learning and programmed agents to play [OpenAI](https://gym.openai.com/) basic environments.

    <p>I participated in the  <a href="https://ginger.sph.harvard.edu/"> Global Initiative for Neuropsychiatric Genetics Education in Research </a> during 2020 winter, this is a one-week training course run in collaboration with 
      <a href="https://ginger.sph.harvard.edu/2020/02/11/ginger-on-site-training-in-campeche-mexico-january-2019/"> NeuroMex </a> in Mexico. The course is designed to introduce fundamental statistical and epidemiological concepts and R programming to clinical researchers performing GWAS studies in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/"> Broad institute of MIT & Harvard </a>.

    <p>I also participated at 
      <a href="https://www.clubesdeciencia.org/"> Clubes de Ciencia Mexico </a> where I paired up with an engineer to teach a course for Mexican undergraduate students on 
      <a href="https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/estudiantes/clubes2018/"> artificial intelligence and electrical engineering </a>
