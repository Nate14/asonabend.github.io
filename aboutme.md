I am a PhD candidate at the [Biostatistics Department](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) advised by [Dr. Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/). I'm also part of the [Center for a Learning Health System](https://celehs.netlify.app/).

I am primarily interested in developing reinforcement learning methods to deal with challenging data settings.
