I am a PhD candidate at the [Biostatistics Department](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) advised by [Dr. Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/). I'm also part of the [Center for a Learning Health System](https://celehs.netlify.app/).

I am primarily interested in developing reinforcement learning methods to deal with challenging data settings. I have been working on 

My research has been motivated by healthcare, specically sequential settings where outcomes are expensive to measure and
depend on all previous history, such as chronic diseases. Iâ€™m interested in developing theory and methods for: 1) reinforcement learning
in semi-supervised, non-Markovian settings, 2) unsupervised classication methods using natural language processing. These
methods are used for optimizing disease treatments, and phenotyping with electronic health records.
