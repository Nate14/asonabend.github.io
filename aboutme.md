### About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the [Biostatistics Department](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) advised by [Dr. Tianxi Cai](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/). I'm also part of the [Center for a Learning Health System](https://celehs.netlify.app/).

I'm focused on developing reinforcement learning and natural language processing methods for real-world applications which have theoretical guarantees. I focus on healthcare and biomedical applications which usually involve partially observed rewards, the need for learning interpretable and safe offline policies. In particular my PhD dissertation deals with the optimizing dynamic treatment regimes in the following topics:

- Semi-supervised reinforcement learning and doibly robust value function estimation for 
- Learning domain-specific safe and interpretable policies using hypothesis testing  
- Using a surrogate convex loss function to optimize dynamic treatment regimes

I'm also highly interested in using natural language processing methods for phenotyping and automatic diagnosis in settings where labels are not available for training.
